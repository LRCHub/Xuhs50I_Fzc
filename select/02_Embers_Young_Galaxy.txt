Oh lord, there's a ghost train running through my head
Every night I her it serenade the sunset
Oh lord, there's a deep blue ocean in my dreams
Calling to me from behind the veil of sleep
I'm afraid I've lost my way
Afraid I've lost my way
I set out like a scout
But I've run out
Oh lord, there's a beach tree where I find my shade
I remember breaking down beneath it's sway
Oh lord, there's a cascade mountain in my dreams
Calling to me from behind the fog of sleep
And It's always out of reach
It's always out of reach
I set out like a scout
But I've run out
Father mother I burn so true
My blaze is brighter when near to you
I smoke and spark without your fuel
An ember from the heart of you
Sisters brothers I burn for you
I light the night searching for you
I signal the sky for you
An ember from the heart of you
An ember from the heart of you
An ember from the heart of you
