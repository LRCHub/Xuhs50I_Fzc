Bloodstains, not rose petals lie on the path
To the gluttonous bed of the whore
For she who is Satan, the waiting bloodbath
Is preparing her nations for war
For war!
Anthropogenic, dark angels wring
The fabric of life free of tears
Choking black fronds from the censers they bring
Encircle as Apocalypse nears
Midnight is the phase
Seismic second waves
End of final days near
Sorrowed Holocene
Blackened back to clean
Like Man has never been here
Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again
Unsympathetic judgement descends
Nine billion souls under heel
Storm-clouds ablaze, razors slice through the ends
Of the earth with insatiable zeal
Midnight is the phase
Seismic second waves
End of final days near
Sorrowed Holocene
Blackened back to clean
Like Man has never been here
Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
it is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
That brings on the pain
Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again
Our lengthening reach went astray
Ignoring the laws of our brittle existence
The universe, clawed, tore it away
Life is a dream in an endless charade
Armageddon deadens
History warned us but we chose to pray
We murdered all hope for the flame
For the ghost of humanity to rise once again
Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
That brings on the pain
Nothing but burnt skies ever learnt
The fate of that terrible game
It is not this stirred circus
Strength that deserts us
Fires that hurt us
But the dying of the embers
That murders all hope for the flame
