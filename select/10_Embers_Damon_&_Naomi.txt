Embers all through the night
Sleeping the day away
Waking to find a different light
Wanting another way

The fire died before too long
The answer lay in ashes

Quiet night all through the day
Waiting for light to arrive
Arching for signs it still exists
Hoping it could survive

The fire died before too long
The answer lay in ashes

Endless nights I've laid awake
Knowing the way it must end
Dreaming of how it was before
Wishing to be set free

The fire died before too long
The answer lay in ashes
